Source-Informed Segmentation Tool (SISTool) toolbox for MATLAB:
---------------------------------------------------------------
SISTool is an open-source toolbox for segmenting EEG data using the source-informed segmentation algorithm
proposed in [1-4].



Installing SISTool:
-------------------
To install SISTool toolbox, add the SISTool folder to MATLAB's search paths.



Running SISTool:
----------------
To run the toolbox, type SISTool (make sure to capitalize the first letters).



Data Format:
------------
The native data format of SISTool toolbox consists in a structure with the following fields:

data       - An array of dimentions (#channels * #frames * #trials) containing the EEG data. This
             field is necessary.
segpnts    - A cell vector of length (#trials) with each cell containing a vector of length (#segs)
             giving the beginning segment boundaries in [msec]. The first segment boundary is always
             0.
start_time - The starting time of all EEG signals in [msec].
srate      - The sampling rate of the EEG data in [Hz].
Wr         - The reference window in [msec].
Wd         - The decision window in [msec].
Ws         - The sliding window in [msec]. This field may be empty to indicate the default value of
             (Ws = Wr).
Wp         - The step in [msec]. This field may be empty to indicate the default value of
             (Wp = 1/srate).
Wv         - The overlap in [msec]. This field may be empty to indicate the default value of (Wv = 0).
time       - The time line in [msec].

SISTool can import/export data in the native format from MATLAB's workspace. SISTool can also load/save
data in the native format as .mat files. The data structure in loaded/saved data is always named "EEG".

SISTool can also import arrays with dimensions defined as in the structure field "data" directly from
MATLAB's workspace.
