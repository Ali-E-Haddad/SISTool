Source-Informed Segmentation Tool (SISTool) toolbox for MATLAB:
---------------------------------------------------------------
SISTool is an open-source toolbox for segmenting EEG data using the source-informed
segmentation algorithm proposed in [1-3].



Installing SISTool:
-------------------
To install SISTool toolbox, add the SISTool folder to MATLAB's search paths.



Running SISTool:
----------------
To run the toolbox, type SISTool (make sure to capitalize the first letters).
